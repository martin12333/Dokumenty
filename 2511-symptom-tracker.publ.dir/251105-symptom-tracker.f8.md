Let's assume some distant similarities  between computers and human brains 

Let's assume some close similarities between LLMs and human brains 

Let's assume that human brains have something like the attention heads in LLMs

##


Human short-term memory capacity is estimated to be around 7±2 syllables ... computer analogy could be 1 SIMD register in the CPU that holds data temporarily ...

Human working memory capacity is estimated to be around 4 chunks ... computer analogy could be 4 CPU registers with pointers to different memory locations ...

Humans have mid-term memory that can store information for days to months ... computer analogy could be the RAM that holds data for active processes ...

Long-term memory in humans can store vast amounts of information for years ... computer analogy could be the hard drive or SSD that stores data persistently ...

Interrupt handling in computers could be analogous to how the human brain processes sudden stimuli or distractions, temporarily halting ongoing tasks to address urgent matters before resuming.

CPU Interrupt Handling
- CPU receives an interrupt signal from a hardware device (e.g., keyboard, mouse, timer).
- **The CPU saves the current state of execution (program counter, registers) onto the stack.**
- The CPU jumps to a predefined interrupt handler routine to address the interrupt.
- After handling the interrupt, the CPU restores the saved state from the stack.

## my ... human patient, interrupt handling

- The brain receives a sudden stimulus (e.g., a request for attention from the family)
- the brain is afraid of losing short-term memory of the current task, and of losing working memory context, and of losing mid-term memory 
- the brain can get overwhelmed by trying to hold too much in short-term and working memory at once
- the brain could repeat the current short-term memory content to itself to try to retain it until getting to a safe place to write it down
- the brain could use external tools to offload memory (e.g., writing things down, using reminders, notes, apps)
- the brain could try to note something from mid-term memory to avoid losing it ... positions?? of some attention heads??
- 
- so, **the brain saves the context of the current task to a piece of paper or a note-taking mobile app**
- The brain addresses the interrupt (e.g., responds to the family request)
- After addressing the interrupt, the brain retrieves the saved context from the note and resumes the original task.
