# /// from a discussion with AI on 251212 about  my mindfiles



I work towards creating and collecting  my own Terasem (transhumanist)  mindfiles.

I have prepared the first document.

For historical reasons, the document is named "250825-@skupina-meta-informace,emergency.f8.md".


It is a work in progress.




// ai various digital artifacts, writings, and data that reflect my memories, values, and personality.

# gemini 
In the context of Terasem, **mindfiles** are digital archives of a person's memories, mannerisms, values, and beliefs, intended to one day create a sentient digital copy (or "mindclone") of that individual.

Today, while Terasem still uses the term "mindfile," the broader AI and 
==digital legacy industries use several other terms to describe this concept.

### 1. Direct Terasem/Lifenaut Synonyms
These terms are used specifically within the Terasem Movement or its LifeNaut project:
* **Digital Reflection:** LifeNaut often refers to the data you upload as creating a "digital reflection" of yourself.
* **Beme:** Coined by Terasem, this refers to the smallest unit of a person's consciousness or uniqueness (similar to a "meme" or "gene" of personality). A mindfile is essentially a collection of "bemes."
* **Cyber-consciousness:** Often used to describe the *goal* of the mindfile—preserving one's consciousness in a cybernetic format.

### 2. Modern Tech & AI Industry Terms
Outside of Terasem, the concept of capturing a person's data to create a simulation is a major sector of AI. These are the terms you will hear today:

* ==**Digital Twin:** The most common modern equivalent. A "Digital Twin" usually refers to a virtual model of a physical object, but in this context, it is a "Personal Digital Twin"—an AI trained on your data to mimic your decision-making and personality.
* 
* ==**Personal AI / PAI:** A more functional term for an AI model trained specifically on an individual's personal data (emails, chats, journals) to act as their proxy.
* 
* **Interactive Persona:** Used by companies like StoryFile, referring to a video-based AI that can answer questions in the subject's voice and mannerisms.
* **Griefbot / Deadbot:** (Often pejorative) Terms used by the media to describe AI avatars created from the data of deceased individuals to allow the living to "chat" with them.

### 3. Descriptive & Academic Terms
Researchers and archivists use these terms to describe the *data* aspect of a mindfile:
* ==**Digital Legacy:** The broad collection of all digital assets (social media, photos, documents) a person leaves behind.
* ==**Lifelog:** A continuous digital record of a person's daily life (video, audio, biometric data).
* ==**Identity Archive:** A curated collection of data meant to preserve the specific identity of an individual.

### Summary of Differences
| Term | Context | Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mindfile** | Terasem / Transhumanism | The **database** of your personality (memories, values). |
| **Mindware** | Terasem / Transhumanism | The **software** that will eventually "run" the mindfile to create consciousness. |
| **Mindclone** | Terasem / Transhumanism | The **result**: the sentient digital entity created from the mindfile + mindware. |
| **Digital Twin** | Modern Tech / Enterprise | A functional **simulation** of a person (often used for productivity or simulation, not necessarily immortality). |

### Next Step
Would you like to know more about the specific file formats or data types (e.g., specific psychological questionnaires or "beme" collection methods) that Terasem recommends for building a mindfile?
