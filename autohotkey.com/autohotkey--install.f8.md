### [Run with UI Access](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/Program.htm#Installer_uiAccess)

When installing under Program Files, the installer creates an additional set of AutoHotkey exe files that can be used to work around some [common UAC-related issues](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/FAQ.htm#uac). These files are given the "_UIA.exe" suffix. When one of these UIA.exe files is used by an administrator to run a script, the script is able to interact with windows of programs that run as admin, without the script itself running as admin.

==`!=` is now always case-insensitive, like `=`, while `!==` has been added as the counterpart of `==`.
