Block specific apps and websites or even the entire internet, based on your custom lists.

Enable Locked Mode, which prevents you from ending a session early or editing blocklists until the session ends—great for resisting the urge to override your own plan.

✅ Freedom can do this:

You create a blocklist (e.g. YouTube, games, socials).

Start a session for a set duration (say, 30 minutes).

Turn on Locked Mode → this prevents you from ending the session early.

Result: those apps/sites are completely inaccessible until the timer ends → you’re “forced” into a break.

Downside: Freedom doesn’t have a built-in “repeat every hour” rule—you’d need to set up multiple sessions manually for the day.




Option 2: AppBlock (simpler for hourly cycles)

Lets you define rules like: “Block these apps every hour for 10 minutes.”

You can set recurring schedules (e.g. blocklist active from :00 to :10 of every hour).

Much less setup than Freedom if you want that exact hourly rhythm.

I checked: StayFree *can* block apps on a schedule (“Focus Mode”, “Block on a schedule”) which means you could make times during the day when distracting apps (including browsers) are blocked. citeturn0search1turn0search0turn0search11turn0search10

However, StayFree **doesn’t seem to support** a built-in “every hour for exactly 10 minutes” cycling schedule (block for 10 minutes each hour) at least as clearly as some other apps do. Users report that it supports schedules in blocks of hours or specific periods. citeturn0search4turn0search1turn0search0

- Lets you define rules like: *“Block these apps every hour for 10 minutes.”*  
- You can set recurring schedules (e.g. blocklist active from **:00 to :10 of every hour**).

If you want, I can check whether StayFree *recently* added hourly cyclic blocking in your region, or suggest a workaround.

ChatGPT said:

Luciano Floridi’s concept of “information as a form of life” comes from his broader theory of the infosphere and inforgs (informational organisms). Here’s a concise but deep explanation:
