Thank you! For now, it sends the whole file up to your cursor. I do plan to make it more flexible and customizable in the future, though. One of the main reasons for why I should is that sometimes the whole file is too much for the language model - completions might stop working entirely at the bottom of a long note, for example.


Thank you for this info 💚
