// windows settings

>  What worked for me was going into the windows settings and changing the Cursos Blinkrate to the lowest setting.

big thanks for the info ℹ️💚! a note: restart -- reload from palette is not enough ... i had to close the window, and later open it

btw,
i am  slightly scared , that it is so difficult to set-up this accessibility essential feature ... disable cursor blinking

about this topic

i am unable to find a more official thread at reddit

i am  unable to find any  thread at github

d. Use the following CSS and change the transparency of the cursor to 10% so it doesn’t appear that prominently. Hope it works!
If anyone finds another solution, please update here:
    `body {       color:#000000;         caret-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.1);`
