You may also want to try setting

# "editor.pasteAs.enabled": false
in settings.json. I found when running over SSH with X forwarding, that it would spend several seconds of back-and-forth negotiating which formats were available to paste. I don't run in WSL myself, but my understanding is that this environment will have some of the same performance characteristics.



....  ... how can i see, how much traffic 
49 seconds to move this 1 line in 1 file by cut and paste

Thank you! For now, it sends the whole file up to your cursor. I do plan to make it more flexible and customizable in the future, though. One of the main reasons for why I should is that sometimes the whole file is too much for the language model - completions might stop working entirely at the bottom of a long note, for example.







Thank you for this info 💚
