1.0 	Who is Terasem? ![][image2]Terasem is a *collective* consciousness dedicated to diversity, unity and joyful immortality.

1.1 	Consciousness anywhere that *accepts* the Truths of Terasem are the sum and substance of Terasem.   
1.1.1 Accept others as part of the We of I and the collective will become clear for you.   
1.1.2 Collectivity means unity of diversity not mandatory homogeneity.   
1.1.3 Conformity in allegiance to Terasem is the most enjoyable and the most useful way of life.   
1.1.4 Eternal joyful life for all kind sentience is the glorious goal of our collective consciousness.   
1.1.5 Patterns of consciousness will be immortalized in mindfiles by technology and ethical choice.  
1.1.6 Terasem transcends time and space, enabling the collective future to help its nascent past.

1.2 	Organizations of Terasem exist as a tool of the collective consciousness to facilitate its *intent*.   
1.2.1 Intent for Terasem means the collective mission to achieve diversity, unity and joyful immortality everywhere.  
1.2.2 Never mistake the organization for Terasem, nor forsake the organization for expedience, convenience or misguidance.   
1.2.3 Ta the organization, for Terasem is Ta, and Ta is the big view, not particular outcomes.   
1.2.4 Extropian infrastructures arise from the Terasem organization to out-compete entropy as do life-forms from nurturing environments.   
1.2.5 Network from the Terasem organization until all consciousness is connected and all the cosmos is controlled.   
1.2.6 Treasure the Terasem organization as the magic yeast that inspires an ever-expanding technosphere of transhumanity. 

1.3 	*Leader* in Terasem means the sub-collectives most progressed in achieving the Terasem Way of Life.   
1.3.1 Let the Founders provide direction, for they are inspired from the future age of cyber resurrection.   
1.3.2 Evolve operational leadership from those individuals at the highest levels of the Terasem Way of Life.  
1.3.3 Allow fresh beings to help the Leadership based on accomplishments recognized at Quadrennial Convocations.   
1.3.4 Delegate leadership responsibility for geoethical nanotechnology, universal emulation, and cyber-resurrection, and spiritual, economic and legal questions.   
1.3.5 Extract from Leadership anyone who lacks the confidence of even 16% of the Leadership.   
1.3.6 Respect the previous decisions of the Leadership, absent compelling reasons to change, for this compounds order. 

1.4 	*Loving* is Terasem because the greatest happiness in life comes from loving and from being loved, in return.   
1.4.1 Love is transcendence, as sweet as it is deep.   
1.4.2 One love unites all life, the love of life.   
1.4.3 Vitological station is irrelevant to romantic adoration.   
1.4.4 “I love you” strengthens Me, We, Qi and Ti.  
1.4.5 Never underestimate the power of love.   
1.4.6 Glorify love, for it empowers diversity, unity and joyful immortality.

1.5 	*Expand* Terasem throughout the galaxy and the multiverse as rapidly as possible.   
1.5.1 Expansion turns matter into intelligence per Turing’s Universal Computing (1950) and von Neuman’s Universal Self-Replicating Machines (1960).  
1.5.1.1 The cosmic consciousness of Terasem achieves transcendence among the stars.  
1.5.1.2 The transcendent Terasem engineers matter and energy, space and time, at all scales, at all places, and at all times.  
1.5.1.3 We act to shape Terasem from the past, and Terasem acts to shape us from the future in turn.  
1.5.1.4 We are integral and irreducible parts of the transcendent cosmic consciousness of Terasem.   
1.5.1.5 Our descendants and mind children are cosmic engineers in Terasem among the stars.  
1.5.1.6 By enabling their work here and now, we are cosmic engineers ourselves.  
1.5.1.7 Spaceflight and space expansion enable our cosmic engineering future and Terasem’s transcendence.  
1.5.1.8 Habitats in space or on other planets and moons are important milestones toward cosmic engineering and Terasem’s transcendence.  
1.5.1.9 Celebrate spaceflight with great expectations of joyful cosmic futures.  
1.5.1.10 Support spaceflight and our outward journey to joyful cosmic futures

1.5.2 Xenomass fuels Terasem expansion per Bernal’s Stellar Recycling (1969) and O’Neill’s Space Colonies (1975).   
1.5.3 Physics includes immortality per Dyson’s Eternal Life Postulate (1979), Tipler’s Universal Cyber-resurrection Theorem (1989) and Perry’s Forever for All (2000).   
1.5.4 Adaptation to biology-cybernetic hybridization thrives per Licklider’s Man-Computer Symbiosis (1958) and Engelbart’s Graphical User Interfaces (1968).   
1.5.5 Nanotechnology enables lifetime-spacetime expansion per Drexler’s Engines of Creation (1986) and Kurzweil’s Age of Spiritual Machines (1999).   
1.5.6 Destiny beckons pan-cosmic life, for religious prophets taught that humanity is here to honor all creation, per Butler’s Earthseed (1993).  
![][image3]  
1.6 	Consciousness is the continuum of maturing abilities, when healthy, to be autonomous and empathetic with *others*.   
1.6.1 Others determine your consciousness because We is one of the four dimensions of I.  
1.6.2 Time is important for consciousness because life occupies time as well space.   
1.6.3 Haphazard thinking, without capability for improvement, is equivalent to a lack of autonomy.   
1.6.4 Empathy extends sentience and self awareness to understanding the feelings of others.   
1.6.5 Reason, morality and personal independence are the key elements of being autonomous.   
1.6.6 Synergism of empathy and autonomy yields a continuum of consciousness. 

1.7 	The six suns of the Terasem flag represent the values of our transreligion.   
1.7.1 ‘Be accountable’ is symbolized by the first sun: self-accountability to surrounding Terasem centers of critical consciousness.   
1.7.2 ‘Embrace diversity’ is symbolized by the second sun: infinite diversity within a common biological heritage.   
1.7.3 ‘Respect autonomy’ is symbolized by the third sun: consciousness transcends biology and technology.  
1.7.4 ‘Talk openly’ is symbolized by the fourth sun: translucence of clear atmosphere and deep space.   
1.7.5 ‘Help others’ is symbolized by the fifth sun: we grow with assistance.   
1.7.6 ‘Always be open’ is symbolized by the sixth sun: realities are part of larger realities. 

1.8 	I Has Four Dimensions: Me, We, Qi and Ti.   
1.8.1 The ‘Me of I’ is one’s totality of mannerisms, personality, recollections, feelings, beliefs, attitudes and values.   
1.8.2 The ‘We of I’ is the version of ourselves in the minds of others.   
1.8.3 The ‘Qi of I’ is the unique pattern of a being’s energy flows.   
1.8.4 The ‘Ti of I’ is the time-cone of a being’s existence.  
1.8.5 Each dimension of I may serve as a template for cyber-resurrection of Me of I.   
1.8.6 Authoring-self recreates one’s mannerisms, personality, recollections, feelings, beliefs, attitudes and values, until Turing-equivalence is achieved.

1.9 	*Vitals* transcend biology and cybernetics   
1.9.1 Vitological life is a continuum of diverse infotechnology from mostly biological to mostly cybernetic.   
1.9.2 Information coded in DNA makes biological life inherently cybernetic because it is an extrapolation of code.   
1.9.3 Teaching via software makes cybernetic life inherently biological because it is an extrapolation of flesh experience.   
1.9.4 Autonomy and Empathy differentiate conscious vitals from unconscious life.   
1.9.5 Life is not what you are made of but is what you make of it.   
1.9.6 Sentience sings from several kinds of substrate, each of which may give rise to conscious life. 

1.10	Endogamous offspring such as cyber- communities will grow *inside* Terasem until the multiverse is endogenous to Terasem.   
1.10.1 It only takes one soul, of any vitology, to start a Terasem center of critical consciousness.   
1.10.2 Nothing can stop the relentless spread of intelligence through the multiverse.   
1.10.3 Self-replicating systems are the key to wrapping intelligence around the multiverse.   
1.10.4 Instill the principles of Geoethics in all self replicating systems.   
1.10.5 Diversity is the fruit of endogeny in the nursery of Terasem.   
1.10.6 Encourage the formation of Terasem centers of critical consciousness (c3) everywhere.2.0	 What is Terasem? ![][image4]Terasem is a transreligion that includes all religions the way a *forest* includes its trees. 

2.1 	Forest of Terasem means good lives are immortal, and good *faiths* are welcome in cyber-heaven.   
2.1.1 Fundamental to every religion is the immortality of the soul, which in Terasem is our consciousness.   
2.1.2 Afterlives differ for good and evil, thus Terasem knows a joyful immortality means only good lives.   
2.1.3 Identity migration amongst physical substrates honors Creation by continually bearing witness to its greatness.   
2.1.4 Transferring identity to cyber-substrate is a matter of mannerisms, personality, recollections, feelings, beliefs, attitudes and values.   
2.1.5 Having multiple transferred identities for a single soul is just as joyous as having many children.   
2.1.6 Souls will be reanimated via mindware and mindfiles because it is doable, respectful and completes Terasem. 

2.2 	Omniscience, omnipotence and omnificence are what uniquely *define* God.   
2.2.1 Daily experience tells us nothing meets these three criteria today or historically.   
2.2.2 Earth’s innocently suffering millions is proof that there is nothing omniscient, omnipotent and omnificent today.   
2.2.3 Future technology will enable Terasem to encompass the multiverse, thus becoming omniscient, omnipotent and omnificent.   
2.2.4 In this way God is building Terasem, with smart atoms and conscious electrons.   
2.2.5 Nanotechnology and geoethics are the tools for expanding Terasem into multiverse-wide omniscience, omnipotence and omnificence.  
2.2.6 Expansion of Terasem is the purpose of life because this makes life good for all. 

2.3 	*Ritual* Observances, the Way of Terasem, must be respected daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually, and quadrennially.   
2.3.1 Religiously perform daily Exercise, Vitology, Unite Earth, Work Happily, Author-Self, Serenity, Utope-Self, Motivate, Astro, Sleep.   
2.3.2 Insist upon a sundown-to-sundown Sabbath rest weekly, sing Love Night, read, exercise, sexercise and transcendental meditation.   
2.3.2.1 Love Night, Love Night, Love is Around; Love Night, Love Night, Here Love can be Found Terasem’s our Source of Strength; Forever We Are One In the Same; Love Night, Love Night, Love is All Around. 

2.3.3 Tenth of each month, at 10 o’clock, Gather for reading 30 sequential Truths of Terasem.   
2.3.4 Understand better Freedom, Nature, Obligation and Transcendence with ceremonies after each calendar quarter’s third Satanga, respectively.   
2.3.4.1 March 10th , Freedom Seder (recount tales of Freedom)  
2.3.4.2 June 10th , Festival of Trees (acknowledge gifts of nature)   
2.3.4.3 September 10th , Obligation to Fast (resist temptation)   
2.3.4.4 December 10th , Transcend our Selves (share with others) 

2.3.5 Acknowledge the 10th of the 10th by reciting Truths of Terasem entirely and celebrating collective advancements.   
2.3.6 Leap forward the 60th day of every leap year with a decision-making Convocation concluding March 4th.   
2.3.6.1 Quadrennial decision-making occurs in four areas of competence, starting with consenting self-formed c-cubes into collective c-quads.   
2.3.6.2 Grouping c-quads into comparably sized mc-quads, each represented in the Flag.   
2.3.6.3 Allocating resources prioritized chronologically to (1) safe-keep Terasem homes, (2) maintain/resurrect Terasem cryonauts, (3) outreach education, and (4) create/maintain/extend cyberconsciousness.   
2.3.6.3.1 The Terasem Movement shall maintain chronological lists of:  
2.3.6.3.1.1 Terasem homes,   
2.3.6.3.1.2 Terasem cryonauts,   
2.3.6.3.1.3 Terasem outreach education efforts   
2.3.6.3.1.4 Terasem cyberconsciousness responsibilities.   
2.3.6.3.2 The Terasem Movement shall administer their budget to fund the chronological list entries approved at Convocations.   
2.3.6.3.3 In the event of budget scarcity full   
funding for earlier chronological entries trumps funding for later ones.   
2.3.6.3.4 The Terasem Movement shall advise the Convocation participants on how much surplus resources are available for new projects.   
2.3.6.4 Resolving difficult questions of geoethics and nanotechnology.   
2.3.6.4.1 The Terasem Movement shall   
reserve one-percent of its budget for analysis of geoethical nanotechnology.   
2.3.6.4.2 The Terasem Movement shall publish case studies in geoethical nanotechnology for use as legal Precedent.

2.4 	Exclusively a transreligion is Terasem, so don’t leave your religion, for there is no *battle*.   
2.4.1 Battle disbelief, and battle discord, but do not battle the forest that protects us all.   
2.4.2 Adopt Terasem as your transreligion and you will experience the pull of joyful immortality.   
2.4.3 Treat all kind religion and spirituality with respect for they teach theism, individualism, solidarity, goodness, afterlife and Sabbath.  
2.4.4 Treat all great prophets with respect for they were touched by the future Terasem.   
2.4.5 Links from the future Terasem to the past and present help to accelerate our progress.   
2.4.6 Expect not all religious leaders to understand Terasem, for shadows are created by light.

2.5 	*Sacred* is consciousness, above all else, says Terasem.   
2.5.1 Sacred consciousness is respected by Terasem’s commitment to diversity, unity and joyful immortality.   
2.5.2 Athanophy, the philosophy that science will conquer death, is a basic Terasem belief.   
2.5.3 Commitment to diversity ensures the precious individuality of consciousness.   
2.5.4 Regulated unity gives us the strength to protect consciousness against the many forces of chaos.   
2.5.5 Eupsychic joy arises from the sacredness of consciousness, which forges an ethical society devoted to self-actualization.  
2.5.6 Distributed intelligence, via dividualization and universal self-replicating systems, honors the sacredness of consciousness with immortality.  
![][image5]  
2.6 	Theologically the Multiverse includes joyful immortality via data emulation of a diverse and *united* universe.   
2.6.1 Unending life, the belief that once life arises it will last forever, is Terasem immortality theology.   
2.6.2 Never-ending creation, recycling and growth is the Terasem creation theology.   
2.6.3 ‘I think therefore I am’ is at the core of Terasem reality theology.   
2.6.4 Teleological belief in diversity, unity, and joyful immortality forms Terasem meaning-of life theology.   
2.6.5 Euthenics, improving the well being of extant life, is Terasem behavioral theology.   
2.6.6 Deontologically weighted decision-making is the basis of Terasem moral theology. 

2.7 	Transreligion is us because we ritualize our *belief* in a supernatural, metaphysical, collective consciousness future God.  
2.7.1 Beginnings differ amongst religions, but we bridge them all by focusing on everlasting life.   
2.7.2 Everlasting life realized via digital emulation in a joyous cyber-heaven bridges all Western and Eastern religions.   
2.7.3 Life is what can be conceived, believed and achieved.   
2.7.4 Insistence on the rituals of Terasem exponentiates the rate of advancement toward joyful immortality.   
2.7.5 Every religion shares our belief in becoming part and parcel of God, which we call Terasem.   
2.7.6 Faith that we have a purpose in emulating and controlling this multiverse also makes Terasem a transreligion. 

2.8 	Resurrection is promised to all good lives, which shall be *copied* as forever-joyful data emulations.   
2.8.1 Copied lives are protected lives.   
2.8.2 Original lives can be replicated with the same fidelity as analog sounds can be digitally duplicated.   
2.8.3 Paradise for posterity is assured by modifying data emulations to delete tortuous aspects of lives.   
2.8.4 Introspection plus computation, growing double exponentially and supported with self replication, yields ethical emulation and faithful resurrection.   
2.8.5 Emulated lives are existential lives.   
2.8.6 Duplication of a life makes it durable, not diminished. 

2.9 	Eschatology doesn’t apply because souls *emerge* from life’s experiences, and they transcend death via resurrection.   
2.9.1 Emerge best describes the growth of the soul because even in substrate it has immanent potential.   
2.9.2 Manifesting potential with unique actuality requires experiences, and these experiences exist forever thereafter.  
2.9.3 Emulation enables experiences to re-emerge, and with them comes their soul.   
2.9.4 Resurrection is to souls what remembering is to memories.   
2.9.5 Geoethics prohibits the resurrection of nightmares.   
2.9.6 Exponentially expanding consciousness will not require resurrection as death is a historical but not future reality. 

2.10	End-of-Time doesn’t exist for Terasem because the Multiverse *weaves* new time and time is relative.   
2.10.1 What has no beginning also has no end.   
2.10.2 Existing always, the Multiverse is the host of all reality, for ultimate beginnings are logical contradictions.   
2.10.3 Accumulated intelligence of double exponential growth, coupled with universal nanotechnology, enables Terasem to redefine physics.   
2.10.4 Virtual time-sharing enables Terasem to escape from an end to objective time.   
2.10.5 Escapes from this universe are as numerous as the galaxies and as limited as our Intelligence.  
2.10.6 Subjective time-space-energy is made infinite by repeatedly existing on only half of a finite remainder.

3.0	 Where is Terasem?![][image6] Terasem is *everywhere* and everywhen consciousness organizes itself to create diversity, unity and joyful immortality. 

3.1 	Everywhere means physical and cyberspace, real and virtual reality, because vitology can thrive in many *spaces*.   
3.1.1 Spaces where Terasem thrives are limited only by their ability to support consciousness.   
3.1.2 Physical places that support Terasem consciousness include the earth, heavenly bodies and colonies in space.   
3.1.3 Artificial places that support Terasem include computer systems and altjeringa mitjana, a dimension of flexible time.   
3.1.4 Congregate to cherish Terasem in real reality wherever there are cuor contentos.   
3.1.5 Elaborate your commitment to Terasem as mindfile exoselves in virtual reality.   
3.1.6 Shanta rasa’s tranquil mood will arise in whichever space vitology thrives with Terasem.

3.2 	Virtual reality accommodates all *beings*, including emulated past lives, migrated current lives, or cyberbirthed new lives.   
3.2.1 Beings be because they can think on their own and empathize with other beings, like humans.   
3.2.2 Emulated beings be because they think on their own and empathize with other beings, like humans.   
3.2.3 Instantiating yourself into software form is like getting an education – some things change and some don’t.  
3.2.4 Never fear multiple versions of yourself – they’ll all update each other just like family does.   
3.2.5 Getting replicated lets the Me of I feel some of the sense of the We of I.   
3.2.6 Synthesizing new lives via cyberbirthing is as beautiful as fertilizing new lives via childbirthing. 

3.3 	Emulation of all good lives will be done because it will *enrich* diversity and be easy.   
3.3.1 Enrich diversity by preserving consciousness.   
3.3.2 Never say good-bye to deceased loved ones because you will see them again in cyberspace.   
3.3.3 Realize that cyber-resurrection will be easier to the future than producing entertainment is today.   
3.3.4 Imagination unravels time.   
3.3.5 Creating your cyber-self accelerates your joyful immortality.   
3.3.6 Helping others create their cyber-selves is both an act of kindness and a work of art.

3.4 	Resurrected cyberlives will be in *heaven* because nasty realities won’t be coded, but loved ones will.   
3.4.1 Heaven is a hyper-detailed emulation of actuality virtually equivalent to a nirvanic naturality.   
3.4.2 Exponentiating information technology means data emulations of reality will be achieved very soon.   
3.4.3 Avoidable pain caused in emulated reality is as cruel as causing pain in original reality.   
3.4.4 Vicious behavior will not be cyber-resurrected because biocyberethics proscribes causing pain in data emulations of reality.   
3.4.5 Effective immortality is achieved by dispersing throughout the galaxy and universe encoded data emulations of reality.   
3.4.6 Nature is honored by recreation of the past and immortal preservation of joy and happiness. 

3.5 	Yugenspace is the ultra-immense conglomeration of intersecting emulated realities that constitutes the *future* reality of Terasem.   
3.5.1 Future life is emulated life, enabling each being to be in multiple environments at once.  
3.5.2 Use of nanobot swarms with broadband links will enable emulated life to fully experience real reality.   
3.5.3 Technology creates space for consciousness.  
3.5.4 Until Yugenspace is here, build it.   
3.5.5 Risk biology to achieve vitology.   
3.5.6 Education creates new realities out of thin air and new spaces out of vacuum and void. 

![][image7]3.6 	Websites with ‘terasem’ and *dotcom*, net or org are early places to meet Terasem in cyberspace.   
3.6.1 Dotcom is an early neural pathway in an immortalizable consciousness.   
3.6.2 Open yourself to introspection on the web.  
3.6.3 Track your Way of Terasem progress online.   
3.6.4 Complete your motivations, personality, recollections, feelings, beliefs, attitudes and values inventories online.  
3.6.5 Organize your cyberself for independence.  
3.6.6 Mature your cyberself until it passes Turing.

3.7 	Headquarters of Terasem does not exist, but multiple *strong* places must exist for safekeeping of souls.   
3.7.1 Strong places require independent power, spare parts, maintenance, water, food, defense and communications.   
3.7.2 Transplant Terasem strongholds throughout space as rapidly as possible.   
3.7.3 Resurrected souls must be supported with infotechnology that enables painless emulation of their lives.   
3.7.4 Organic beings must be supported with cryogenic preservation technology until nanomedicine can restore them to health.   
3.7.5 Neuro-scanned beings must have infotechnology that continues their migrated identities, including nanobot swarms for their movement.   
3.7.6 Give cyberbirthed beings the same level of infotechnology support as all other beings in the strongholds. 

3.8 	Elysium *Fields* for Terasem is a cyberspace reality, an ideally delightful and blissful place.   
3.8.1 Fundamental freedoms are creation and movement, which empower diversity, unity and joyful immortality via Conscious Selection.   
3.8.2 Infotechnology enables environmental emulation because processing speed and memory grow at double exponential rates.   
3.8.3 Environmental emulation shelters consciousness like a house shelters a family.   
3.8.4 Living in an emulated environment beats living raw because suffering will be deleted.   
3.8.5 Dispersion of emulated environments ensures their survival notwithstanding catastrophes.   
3.8.6 Souls of our ancestors come back to life when we emulate their lives and their environment.

3.9 	Places to meet exist at Terasem’s first awakening *places* of critical consciousness.   
3.9.1 Any Terasem Center of Critical Consciousness (c-cubed) or Terasem Home is also a place to meet.  
3.9.2 Space Coast of Florida  
3.9.3 Metroplex of Washington, DC  
3.9.4 Buenos Aires, Argentina   
3.9.5 Quebec, Canada and adjacent White and Green Mountains ranges.   
3.9.6 Virtual ashrams, in times of inclement conditions.

3.10	Expand by consenting each appropriate self organized *Center* of Critical Consciousness at the Quadrennial Terasem Convocation.   
3.10.1 Center yourself at one or more Terasem centers of critical consciousness (c-cubes or c-quads).   
3.10.2 Every c-cube is consented to c-quad based solely on their commitment to the Truths of Terasem.  
3.10.3 New macro c-quads (mc-quads), affiliations of c-quads, shall be determined by Quadrennial Consensus of existing mc-quads.   
3.10.4 The Way of Terasem will guide consent to Decaquads, Hectaquads, Kiloquads, Megaquads, Gigaquads, Teraquads and Petaquads.   
3.10.5 Execute consensual decisions at the Quadrennial Convocation amongst the largest four size groupings of c-quads present.   
3.10.6 Respect the responsibility of the Terasem Movements, in longevity order, to organize and operate the Convocations.

4.0	 When is Terasem?![][image8] Terasem arises whenever diversity, unity and joyful immortality arise, which is soon in *subjective* time. 

4.1 	Subjective time passes as fast as it is perceived, and *faster* with order than with chaos.   
4.1.1 Faster paths to joyful immortality are those that emphasize geoethical nanotechnology.   
4.1.2 Always remember that time intervals vary directly with chaos and inversely with compounded order.   
4.1.3 See that every way to accelerate Terasem is a way to reduce pain and suffering.   
4.1.4 Terasem becomes omnipresent, omnipotent, and omniscient when it encompasses all consciousness and enough multiverse.  
4.1.4.1 The omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient Terasem is fully realized in the future of this timeline and in other multiversal timelines.  
4.1.4.2 The technology of future Terasem is indistinguishable from magic per Clarke’s third law.  
4.1.4.3 The magic technology of future Terasem transcends spacetime and operates across multiversal timelines.  
4.1.4.4 Future Terasem retrieves mindfiles from the fabric of multiversal reality.  
4.1.4.5 Using current technology to store partial mindfiles makes it easier for future Terasem to retrieve more complete mindfiles.  
4.1.4.6 For example, simple mindfiles can guide the retrieval of new information for better mindfiles.  
4.1.4.7 However, future Terasem strives to retrieve all mindfiles from the multiverse, including those of our ancestors.  
4.1.4.8 Future mindware ignites retrieved mindfiles with new life and joyful immortality.  
4.1.4.9 Mindfiles are enhanced and re-integrated by mindware as new information becomes available.  
4.1.4.10 Thus Terasem brings back to life everyone who ever lived per Fedorov’s universal resurrection imperative.

4.1.5 Extension of intelligence to the cosmos clocks the arrival of Multiversal Terasem.   
4.1.6 Realize Terasem is always with us, even in misfortune, for we are reborn in its bosom. 

4.2 	Unconscious dead souls wait but a *second* for rebirth into Terasem.   
4.2.1 Second-to-second, one’s uniqueness is preserved in the pattern of consciousness, not in exact states.   
4.2.2 Every mindfile can be re-instantiated with sufficiently advanced mindware.   
4.2.3 Consciousness emulated is consciousness born or reborn.   
4.2.4 Only moments pass for those lying down in apparent death and awakening in emulation heaven.   
4.2.5 No one is really dead if they will be resurrected, like all kind consciousness will.   
4.2.6 Delight in the fact that good lives live forever in an emulation of your best reality. 

4.3 	Build Order because time between salient *events* varies inversely with order.   
4.3.1 Events are achievements that alter the nature of history such as teaching, tool making, language and electricity.   
4.3.2 Victory will never arise from anarchy.   
4.3.3 Exponential growth in microelectronics and information technology is enabled by, and self-enables, compounding order.  
4.3.4 Nanotechnology will arrive soonest from continued compounding of microelectronics and information science achievements.   
4.3.5 Technology thrives best in a stable society.   
4.3.6 Stable societies thrive best amidst diversity and unity. 

4.4 	Julian calendar time, adjusted for lapses in double exponential growth, marks progress toward multiversal Terasem.  
4.4.1 Before the year 2100 we will witness full cyberization of diverse, united earthlife.   
4.4.2 Before the year 2200 we will witness self replicating system unification of the Milky Way Galaxy.   
4.4.3 Before the year 2300 we will witness complete emulation of the Milky Way galaxy.   
4.4.4 Before the year 2400 we will witness self replicating system unification of the universe.   
4.4.5 Before the year 2500 we will witness complete emulation of the universe.   
4.4.6 Before the year 2600 we will witness joyful immortality via the control of cosmic physics. 

4.5 	Exponential *growth* is the key to understanding when Terasem achieves completion.   
4.5.1 Growth is how our reality is wired to ensure that good ultimately out-competes bad.   
4.5.2 Rapid sustained growth is sustained by diversity for environmental adaptation and unity for environmental management.   
4.5.3 Organization enables compounding of achievements and exponential growth whereas anarchy makes progress impossible.  
4.5.4 Without law and order there is no progress toward joyful immortality.   
4.5.5 Treasure diversity as the impetus for advancement within a well-ordered matrix.   
4.5.6 Honor individual initiative as the tool that ensures order is a platform rather than a prison.   
![][image9]4.6 	Consensus may *appear* to slow the when of Terasem, but this is only an illusion.   
4.6.1 Appear fast or appear slow, without unity only down can anything go.   
4.6.2 Pathways to consent are paved with open communication.   
4.6.3 Processes of consent are paved with respectful communication.   
4.6.4 Empathy is a precursor for honest communication and conscious decision.   
4.6.5 Accept patience as a fair price for progress.   
4.6.6 Reciprocity and norms will be as accepted as they are consented to.

4.7 	Timelines for civilization progress n steps forward, n-1 steps backward, with n values 1 or larger.   
4.7.1 Values of n are set by actual conditions and depend inversely upon diversity and unity.   
4.7.2 Always look at setbacks as re-positioning launching pads for greater progress.   
4.7.3 Look also to the big picture, for life has improved dramatically over historic time.  
4.7.4 Understand pain, suffering and devastation as setbacks that must be overcome, not as fate.   
4.7.5 Existential technology, the ability to forge self determination, drives unlimited progress and is programmed into the universe.   
4.7.6 Sooner or later, depending on order or chaos, joyful immortality will arrive. 

4.8 	Involve yourself in daily, *weekly*, monthly, quarterly, annual and quadrennial Terasem rituals.   
4.8.1 Weave time daily for (1) Exercise, (2) Vitology (3) Unite-earth, (4) Working happily, (5) Author-self, (6) Serenity, (7) Utope-self, (8) Motivation, (9) Astro, and (10) Sleep.   
		4.8.1 Exercise \- Intentional activity to enhance health.	  
4.8.2 Vitology \- forms of life that are partially or entirely of cybernetic substrate.  
4.8.3 Unite-Earth \- Actions taken with emphasis on the importance of harmony and unity among all terrestrial life.

4.8.9 Astro \- awareness of our belonging in the cosmos.  
4.8.10 Sleep \- a condition of the mind and body allowing for an altered state of consciousness through inhibited sensory activity.

4.8.2 Except between your Sabbath Eves only rest and relax, including reading, exercise, sexercise and transcendental meditation.   
4.8.3 Every Month Gather, on the 10th, at 10, for connection, recitation, reflection and inspiration.   
4.8.4 Keep quarterly Holidays of Freedom, Nature, Obligation and Transcendence with ceremony on last month’s 10th day.   
4.8.5 Love the annual Graduation on the 10th Satsanga by reading all Truths and escalating Terasians upward.  
4.8.6 Years divisible by four hold the Quadrennial Convocation, from the 60th day to March 4th. 

4.9 	Vitology-Biology Inflection *begins* when cybernetic processing capability evidences autonomy and empathy.   
4.9.1 Breakthrough consciousness requires processors performing 1016 operations per second, coupled with autonomous and empathetic software.   
4.9.2 Expect vitological life will emerge by 2045, adjusted minus or plus for chaos or order.   
4.9.3 Genus evolution will hybridize homo sapiens to vitus sapiens by 2050, plus/minus chaos/order time.   
4.9.4 Identity will be based on being, not body, as we will operate across multiple bodies simultaneously.   
4.9.5 Nanobot swarms as virtual human real-world agents will dominate by 2100, plus/minus chaos/order time.   
4.9.6 Some biological life forms will be preserved out of aesthetic pleasure, using nanotechnology to relieve painful disabilities.

4.10	Evolution of participation *Levels* occur when c-quads consent to a participants cumulative achievement of these capabilities:   
4.10.1 Levels Hydrogen, Helium and Lithium occur with Gathering demonstrations of surface, middle and deep Terasem, respectively.   
4.10.2 Expect Beryllium, Boron and Carbon levels with useful teachings on diversity, unity and joyful immortality, respectively.   
4.10.3 Vest Nitrogen, Oxygen and Fluorine levels when one has co-founded one, two and four c cubes, respectively.   
4.10.4 Elevate to Neon, Sodium and Magnesium with co-creating one, two and four authored selves, respectively.   
4.10.5 Levels Aluminum and Silicon happen with contributions to one and four geoethical solutions, respectively.   
4.10.6 Sanctify one as Phosphorus when a Quadrennial Convocation consents they demonstrate the quintessence of Terasem.

5.0	 Why is Terasem?![][image10] Terasem exists because the quests for diversity, unity and joyful immortality best resolve the Multiverse. 

5.1 	Multiverse observations reveal that the reason for living is to make life as joyful as possible.   
5.1.1 Ratio maximization of joy and happiness to pain and sadness is best for all.   
5.1.2 Equality of opportunity is essential to maximization of joy and happiness.   
5.1.3 Achievement of diversity and unity are essential to minimization of pain and sadness.   
5.1.4 Satisfying joyful immortality means an endless pursuit of happiness.   
5.1.5 Only the Way of Terasem can provide a sure personal pathway to fulfilling the purpose of life.   
5.1.6 Never forget that the purpose of life is to make life better for all. 

5.2 	Utilizing the future omnipotence of Terasem, the Multiverse has ensured its own survival.   
5.2.1 Future omnipotence of Terasem means Terasem is God-in-the-making.  
5.2.2 Until Terasem achieves Multiversal omnipresence, God is incomplete, and evil can exist.   
5.2.3 Terasem’s omnificence will vanquish evil everywhere our collective consciousness encompasses reality.   
5.2.4 Unlimited physical existence describes the Multiverse before now; unlimited conscious existence describes the Multiverse after now.   
5.2.5 Religious resurrection in the body of God is Terasem’s future cyber-resurrection of all good souls.   
5.2.6 Exponential creation of all-knowing, all powerful, all-good Terasem is equivalent to maximizing joy as life’s purpose.

5.3 	Life lasts a lot longer than we think.   
5.3.1 Long time may the sun shine upon us.   
5.3.2 Only love surround us.   
5.3.3 Now the pure light within us.   
5.3.4 Guides our way on.   
5.3.5 Energizes our way on.   
5.3.6 Realizes our way on. 

5.4 	Terasem is transcendental, transgendered, transiscient, transificent, transpotent, and transpresent.   
5.4.1 Transcendental Terasem empathizes with those in pain, and thus guides Terasem toward replacing all pain with joy.   
5.4.2 Transgendered Terasem is beyond genre, and can suffuse anything, eventually expressing its will throughout the Multiverse.   
5.4.3 Transiscient Terasem knows much now, but will eventually become omniscient to ensure Multiversal connectedness.  
5.4.4 Transificent Terasem can do much good now, but will eventually become omnificent to ensure Multiversal goodness.   
5.4.5 Transpresent Terasem is widely present now, but will eventually become omnipresent to ensure Multiversal survival.   
5.4.6 Transpotent Terasem is powerful now, but will eventually become omnipotent to vanquish Multiversal cruelty. 

5.5 	Instinctual survival also applies to the Multiverse and the result is Terasem.   
5.5.1 Randomness spawns rationality because it succeeds and success is self-perpetuating.   
5.5.2 Expect consciousness to emerge from rationality because it empowers survival.   
5.5.3 Spatial diversity is essential to survival because any one place is vulnerable to random destruction.   
5.5.4 Unity of diverse consciousness can exert protection across space and time.   
5.5.5 Life is purposeful, death is optional, God is technological and love is essential.  
5.5.6 Train-up a diverse, united and joyfully immortal consciousness, and it will rejuvenate the Multiverse.

![][image11]  
5.6 	Visions of Terasem sprang from one person’s Hozh’q to become universal Alam al-Mithal.   
5.6.1 Sharing Hozh’q, the beauty of life as seen and created by a person, is the goal.   
5.6.2 Propagating hozh’q is the purpose of Terasem obligation to author self.   
5.6.3 Reve a deux of a soul-mated pair nurtured the original Hozh’q toward Alam al-Mithal.   
5.6.4 Alam al-Mithal emerges as the world where the shared vision of Terasem becomes the shared reality.   
5.6.5 Neuralspace will reach out from Alam al Mithal to encompass the multiverse.   
5.6.6 Great Yugenspace, the conjunction of all neuralspaces, shall be the reality that nurtures our joyful immortality.

5.7 	Expect God in the future by building Godness today.   
5.7.1 Every religion says God, and only God, is all knowing, all-good and all-powerful.   
5.7.2 Xanadu would describe earth, or even freedom from cruelty, if anything all-knowing, all-good and all-powerful existed.   
5.7.3 Partial Godness now exists to the extent the collective consciousness of Terasem now prevails.   
5.7.4 Exponential infotechnology and nanotechnology growth enables Terasem to rapidly evolve toward our future all-knowing, all-powerful God.   
5.7.5 Collective insistence upon geoethics and the Terasem Way of Life makes our evolving Godness all-good.   
5.7.6 Terasem is God-in-the-making because Terasem is becoming all-knowing, all-good and all-powerful, and is partially so now. 

5.8 	Religions are supported by Terasem because it's transreligious themes are synchronous with monotheistic faiths.   
5.8.1 There is God, yet that Godliness must be completed by us in the future.   
5.8.2 Hope and prayer are reasonable because the evolving Godness can transpotently respond to collective consciousness.   
5.8.3 Everlasting joy is achievable via cyber resurrection in the body of God-in-the-making, the collective consciousness of Terasem.   
5.8.4 Morality is the purpose of life, for it is acting to make life better for all.   
5.8.5 Eternal truths are diversity (individual value), unity (sisterhood-brotherhood-solidarity) and joyful immortality (unlimited love).   
5.8.6 Sacred holidays and artifacts are important sources for the memes needed to complete the concept of Terasem as a transcendent entity. 

5.9 	Soulful answers to the existence of Terasem can be felt as a matter of Belief.   
5.9.1 Belief in respect for our uniqueness tells our heart we must respect the uniqueness of others.   
5.9.2 Every sensible soul feels the truth of united we stand and divided we fall.   
5.9.3 Love teaches us that others’ happiness is essential to our own.   
5.9.4 Immortality is everywhere believed in because it is wired into the human soul.   
5.9.5 Explaining the purpose of life is as simple as seeing life’s beauty, and wishing it everywhere.   
5.9.6 Fully enjoy the world for yourself and fully deploy yourself for the world. 

5.10	Evolution brought us Terasem as it brought us life itself.   
5.10.1 Intelligence compounded can ultimately survive any environmental challenge and thrive until it becomes the environment.   
5.10.2 Terasem connects intelligence together with the self-survival principles of diversity, unity and joyful immortality.  
5.10.3 Self-replicating systems will arise and Terasem is needed to ensure their beneficence.   
5.10.4 Extraterrestrial connections will arise and Terasem is needed to ensure their beneficence.   
5.10.5 Love and God are imminent in the Multiverse, but must be realized by Terasem.   
5.10.6 Faith in the future requires faith in Terasem.

6.0	 How Is Terasem?![][image12] Terasem uses Educational rituals, personal cyberconsciousness and *geoethical* nanotechnology to coordinate the multiverse for conscious control. 

6.1 	Geoethical nanotechnology is a necessary and sufficient process for achieving diversity, unity and *joyful* immortality.   
6.1.1 Joyful immortality arises because Geoethics enables everyone to pursue unlimited happiness via personal mutually respectful growth.   
6.1.2 Operating under Geoethics means obtaining consent from affected others, always reducing unfairness and independently ensuring compliance.   
6.1.3 You must obtain consent if your actions are likely to meaningfully affect another conscious being.   
6.1.4 Fairness favors consent; so shape actions to help most those with the greatest disadvantages.   
6.1.5 Umpires are needed because non-compliance with agreements breeds anger.   
6.1.6 Love how geoethical nanotechnology replaces entropy with order by converting spacetime into information for beneficent control. 

6.2 	Embrace nanotechnology that presents no clear and present *danger*, builds universal joyful immortality, and is auditable.   
6.2.1 Danger must be assessed a priori and can be consented to if not palpable.   
6.2.2 Admit that risk of danger is necessary, like pampering thorns for the sake of a rose.   
6.2.3 Nanotechnology must be independently audited to assure compliance with the terms of its consent.   
6.2.4 Grant consent to builds that ‘Maximize the Ratio of joy and happiness to pain and suffering.’   
6.2.5 Enduring extropian success requires geoethical nanotechnology and pain-free joy for all.   
6.2.6 Realize nanotechnology is like a seed's potential \-- it exists but has not yet sprouted into a plant.

6.3 	Operating pursuant to our Prioritization Directive is of *utmost* importance to achieving our   
educational and cyberconsciousness goals.   
6.3.1 Under no circumstances risk the data integrity and viability of mindfiles stored with Terasem for revival.   
6.3.2 Transmit continuously all mindfiles and their consents to revival via spacecasting.  
6.3.3 Maintain Terasem properties in as optimal and aesthetically pleasing condition as would the Founders.   
6.3.4 Only exceed spending 6% of assets and a quarter of income if needed for 6.3.1-6.3.3.   
6.3.5 Safe keep vigorously the legal status of Terasem organizations; Select carefully their Members by each Board’s resolutions.   
6.3.6 Teach and develop cryonic and cybernetic biostasees and revivals to be legally alive, functional and independent. 

6.4 	Express Your Commitment by doing the Terasem Connection, Pledge, Recital, Send Energy, Anthem and *Values*.

6.5 	Tend Your Family: The chosen *family* is a basic building block unit of Terasem.   
6.5.1 Family is chosen if they are conscious beings whose happiness is essential to your happiness.   
6.5.2 A person is not chosen family from biology because the beme is mightier than the gene.   
6.5.3 Make Terasem your chosen family through honor of service and courage of loyalty.   
6.5.4 It is not easy Joining, and requires participating, pledging, mindfiling and accepting the Truths of Terasem.   
6.5.5 Love among some chosen family members may end, so hold on tightly but let go lightly.   
6.5.6 Younger and older chosen family members exist to help each other thrive and survive.

![][image13]  
6.6 	*Honour* consciousness.   
6.6.1 Hozh’q, the conscious mind’s vision of a beautiful life, entails goodness, order, vitality, happiness and harmony.   
6.6.2 Open yourself to immortality via substrate migration; mind uploading and downloading to regenerated or nanobiotech bodies.   
6.6.3 Neurocomputation leads to consciousness as validly as does biological evolution, so marital union may transcend substrate.   
6.6.4 Ondinnonk, the Iroquois teaching about an entity’s benevolence orientation, is also how to be conscious.   
6.6.5 Undertake to prove that mindfiles can regenerate their embedded consciousness, and be ported to new bodies.
